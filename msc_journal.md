# Thesis Journal

## April 8th

- Beginning of the study of the MPC book recommended by Elias. Studied/reviewed linear dynamic models.

> It is often the function of an MPC controller to determine in real-time that the output or state constraints are not achievable, and relax them in some satisfactory manner. (MPC Book)

- Started to review Chapter 1.3. Introductory to MPC Regulator with the Linear Quadratic Problem, didn’t advance a lot. Starting point for next MPC study.

> Constraints are the main feature that distinguished MPC from LQ control. (MPC)

- Started to organize the bibliography for Collision Avoidance. Used elicit and already grabbed some interesting articles, even though they might be too generalist and not so useful for space applications. Good for a starting point anyway. Also searched for the Rabbit collision avoidance algorithm of JAXA and found the base paper of their algorithm (CLINIC 2011). Started to read the Introduction of Clinic 2011, and I think it will be very useful. Started to organize what are the approaches for COLA algorithms and how can I start to categorize obstacle avoidance and these algorithms (starting point for the next time). Read the Vayeda 2015 paper, which analysed some collision avoidance algorithms, that maybe aren’t very useful for this application.

- Created the overleaf template for the thesis using Técnico template, maybe it is useful to create another file, a pages file, or maybe try out a .MD file to start writing things that might be already useful for the thesis.

## April 9th

- Proceeded with the study of the MPC book, talked with Thomas regarding maybe complementing this study with non linear predictive control. He provided me his notes from nonlinear control and MPC courses. Next time proceed from chapter 1.4.3. Perceber bem linear optimal state e least squares estimation.

- Started the first tutorials from Basilisk: Basilisk Process and Task Creation and understood how to start basilisk and how to run it after closing the terminal. From now on to be done, getting familiarised with vscode, understand how to push and pull and all those git functions that I don’t understand, and keep on doing the tutorials.

To take into account that haven’t done any revision regarding rendezvous and docking methods. Until Thursday it would be ideal to have an overview and organized analysis of RnD methods, obstacle avoidance algorithms, and being somewhat comfortable with what is the concept of MPC.

Extra tasks for next entry:
1. Understand and organize a .MD file to start taking notes on how to work with Basilisk and most importantly snippets.
2. Overview of Rnd Methods

## April 10th

- Crash course on Git and GitHub to get comfortable with all the nomenclatures I didn’t know. 
- Creation of GitHub repository and test of git remote, push, etc, everything functioning. Basilisk ready to be used.
- Transformation of the previous pages file of this journal do markdown

Tasks from April 9th still have to be done.
Hour debt from today: 4 hours
